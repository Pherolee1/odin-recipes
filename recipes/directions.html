    <ol>
        <li>	In a large skillet, cook the beef and onion over medium-high heat until beef is fully browned. Break up the meat as it cooks. Drain off excess liquid.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl mix together the beef mixture with the Campbell’s Soup, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, frozen mixed vegetables and 1 cup of the shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture into a 12×8-inch shallow baking dish. Top the beef with tater tots.</li>
        <li>Bake at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Top the casserole with shredded cheese and bake for 5 additional minutes until cheese is melted. You’ll know it’s done when the tater tots are golden brown and the casserole is bubbling.
